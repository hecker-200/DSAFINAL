# _**Grid-Navigator: A Graph-Theoretic Pathfinding Simulator**_

This repository is the culmination of our Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course project. The project showcases our understanding and implementation of graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms through a highly interactive and visually intuitive web platform.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [Grid-Navigator Website](https://hecker-200.github.io/DSA-FINAL/)

## **_🚀 Project Overview_**

Grid-Navigator is a web application that visualizes popular pathfinding algorithms in real-time. Built using core web technologies, it allows users to draw walls, place start/end nodes, and run different algorithms to observe how they explore the grid and find the shortest path.

This platform is designed to enhance algorithmic understanding through engaging, hands-on interaction.
